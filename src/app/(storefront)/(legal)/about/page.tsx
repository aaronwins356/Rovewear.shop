          From concept sketch to final polish, each frame is engineered in our Portland studio using bio-acetate and
          aerospace-grade alloys. We collaborate with Zeiss laboratories to integrate adaptive optics that transition from
          sun-drenched expeditions to late-night edits seamlessly.

          Sanity Studio empowers our team to curate capsule releases, artist collaborations, and storytelling modules without
          touching code. As we expand into dropshipping partnerships, the storefront is ready to integrate supplier APIs for
          real-time stock and fulfillment.

          Sustainability anchors our craftâ€”frames are repairable, packaging is recycled, and every order funds ocean cleanup
          initiatives.
